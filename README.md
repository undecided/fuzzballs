## Fuzzballs

### Description

Highly configurable javascript search tool, returns results based on different criteria.

### Current functionality

* Filter by query string
* Sorting by query string matchiness
* Support for extracting a string from non-string objects via supplied transformation

### Usage instructions

TODO. Sorry. Pretty simple though, see app/fuzzballs_spec.coffee

### TODO / Hoped features

* percentage mode: q=whists would find fishsticks at around 50%.
* strict percentage: q=whist doesn't find fishsticks, but q=stiffs would - again, at about 50%
* strict ordered percentage: q=shtick would match

### Documentation

More docs than there are lines of code, and you're reading it.
